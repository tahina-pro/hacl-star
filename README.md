HaCl-star
=========

HaCl* is a formally verified cryptographic library in [F\*],
developed as part of [Project Everest].

HACL stands for High-Assurance Cryptographic Library and its design is
inspired by discussions at the [HACS series of workshops](https://github.com/HACS-workshop).
The goal of this library is to develop *reference* implementations
for popular cryptographic primitives and to verify them for memory safety,
side-channel resistance, and (where applicable) functional correctness.

Research Paper (CCS 2017): https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/536

All code is written and verified in F\* and then compiled to C or to
OCaml for execution.

The primitives and constructions supported currently are:

* Stream ciphers: Chacha20, Salsa20, XSalsa20
* MACs: Poly1305, HMAC
* Elliptic Curves: Curve25519
* Elliptic Curves Signatures: Ed25519
* Hash functions: SHA2 (256,384,512)
* NaCl API: secret_box, box

HACL* can be used in two ways. The verified primitives can be directly
used in larger verification projects.  For example, HACL* code is used
as the basis for cryptographic proofs of the TLS record layer in
[miTLS].  Alternatively, developers can use HACL* through the [NaCl API].
In particular, we implement the same C API as [libsodium] for the
Box and SecretBox primitives, so any application that runs on
libsodium can be immediately ported to use the verified code in HACL*
instead.

# Warning

This library is at the pre-production stage.
Please consult the authors before using it in production systems.


# Verification and Extraction


To verify the F\* code, you need to install the [F\*] typechecker.

To extract F\* code to C, you need to install the [KreMLin] compiler.

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for prerequisites.

For convenience, C code for our verified primitives has already been extracted
and is available in [snapshots/hacl-c](snapshots/hacl-c).
To build the library, you need a modern C compiler (preferably GCC-7) and CMake.

The following command will give you more informations on how to run verification and extraction.
```
make
```

# Performance

HACL* primitives, when compiled to C, are as fast as state-of-the-art
C implementations. You can see the numbers for your platform and C compiler
by running `make test` in the snapshot folder.

To compare its performance with the C reference code in libsodium and openssl,
download and compile [libsodium] with the `--disable-asm` flag
and [openssl] with the `-no-asm` flag.

While the raw performance is quite good, HaCl is not as fast as hand-written
assembly code.  Linking HACL* to verified assembly language components
is a long-term goal.

# Experimental features

The [code/experimental](code/experimental) directory includes other (partially verified) cryptographic primitives that will become part of the library in the near future:
* Elliptic Curves: NIST P-256, Curve448
* Encryption: AES-128, AES-256
* MACs: GCM
* Key Derivation: HKDF

We are also working on a JavaScript backend to F* that would enable us to extract HACL* as a JavaScript library.
